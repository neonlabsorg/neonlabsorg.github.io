You can use Chrome, Opera, Firefox, or on iOS, Android if youâ€™re a mobile user.  \n\nAlthough this tutorial uses the Ubuntu platform, the instructions provided can be applied to other platforms.  \n\nInstalling the MetaMask wallet\nStep 1. Go to the MetaMask Download page. From there, select any platform you use and follow the instructions to load and install the MetaMask on a browser of your device. (Fig. 1 shows an example of installing the MetaMask on the Chrome browser).  \n    \n Fig. 1 - Loading up the MetaMask \n\nStep 2. The MetaMask is essentially a plugin in the form of an extension to a browser. Therefore, the browser supported MetaMask can get additional features. In the window appeared, click Add extension (Fig. 2).  \n    \n Fig. 2   \n\nWhen the MetaMask extension is installed, a fox's face will appear in the upper left corner of the web browser window - this is the company logo. This means that you have successfully installed MetaMask on your device and can start to use it.\nStep 3. Create a wallet if you don't already have one. The MetaMask will offer a choice of two options for creating an account:  \n\nImport an existing wallet using a 12-word passphrase.\nCreate a new wallet.\n\nGo ahead and click Create a Wallet. On the support page Help Us Improve MetaMask appeared click the I agree button.The password generation form should open on the display. Enter a secret code that must contain at least 8 symbols.A secret phrase will be generated automatically. Write down a secret phrase for backup (preferably not on a device connected to the Internet). Without this phrase, your funds cannot be refunded if your device is damaged or lost. Confirm that you have written them down on the next page.  \nAfter that, you should see your wallet linked to your account.\nSetting up the MetaMask wallet\nYou can use your wallet to interact with the Solana cluster via a proxy server. To do this, you need to configure your wallet to the desired proxy server.Depending on the tasks to be solved, as well as on a location of the proxy and Solana, there are 3 options for setting up the MetaMask wallet:  \n\nOption 1: Both the proxy and Solana are hosted on the remote servers.\nOption 2: The proxy is hosted locally, Solana - on a remote server.\nOption 3 (debug mode): Both the proxy and Solana are hosted locally.\n\nStep 4. In the upper-right corner, click the red apple view element. Select settings from the dropdown menu required to connect to the proxy server (Fig. 3).  \n    \n Fig. 3 - Select Settings from the dropdown menu   \n\nThe dropdown menu elements:\n\nMy Accounts - list of accounts created by your wallet.\nAccount 1 - account of your wallet that was created during the MetaMask installation. This account provides management of your wallet.\nCreate Account - allows you to create one more account to interact with new proxy server. You can configure this wallet to interact with multiple proxy servers.\nImport Account - allows you to import your private key generated and saved previously into this wallet and use it in the future.\nConnect Hardware Wallet - allows you to save the private key to an external device (i.e. flash memory) located outside the network, increases the security of your private key. \nSettings - to change the default values. By default, the wallet is configured for Ethereum addresses, including those that you canâ€™t actually use.\n\nStep 5. Click Settings in the dropdown menu. The window with settings menu for selecting a network should open (Fig. 4).  \n    \n Fig. 4 - Choosing a Network   \n\nStep 6. Add the Network choosed (Fig. 5).  \n    \n Fig. 5 - The Networks menu   \n\nThe window opened contains the settings for the 6 default subnets. You need to use these settings to connect to the desired proxy. Click Add Network in the top-right corner.  \nStep 7. Confirm that you fill in the fields on the next page (Fig. 6):  \n\nNetwork Name - defined network name.\nNew RPC URL - path to interface\nChain ID - blockchain id.\nCurrency Symbol - coin ticker (e.g. ETH, BNB).\nBlock Explorer URL (optional) - URL of the block browser.\n\nThe wallet settings depend on the selected option mentioned above. `New RPC URL ' - set for one of them.  \n    \n Fig. 6 - Fill the Fields   \n\nStep 8. Click Save to keep settings.Your MetaMask wallet has been successfully installed and ready to use!\n"},"devportal/testnet/connect_to_solana_via_proxy.html":{"url":"devportal/testnet/connect_to_solana_via_proxy.html","title":"Connection to Solana Testnet via a Proxy Server","keywords":"","body":"Connection to Solana Testnet via a Proxy Server\nGoal\nConnect to Solana evm-loader through a proxy server and run Solana Testnet.  \nDepending on the tasks to be solved, as well as on a location of the proxy and Solana, you can use one of 3 options for configuring the network:\n\nOption 1: The proxy is hosted on a remote virtual server; Solana Testnet is used.\nOption 2: The proxy is hosted locally; Solana Testnet is used.\nOption 3: Both the proxy and Solana are hosted locally (debug mode, allows you to configure your own node locally).\n\nSolana Testnet is an alternative cryptocurrency chain exclusively for developers. It allows developers to run their own node in a test blockchain and experiment without losing real currency.The mainnet and testnet coins are incompatible with each other. Testnet coins have no value and developers cannot treansfer mainnet coins to testnet. Likewise, they cannot transfer testnet coins to mainnet.\nRequirements to your device\nThe MetaMask wallet must be installed on your device.  \n\nAlthough this tutorial uses the Ubuntu platform, the instructions provided can be applied to other Linux platforms.  \n\nOption 1: Interaction with Solana Testnet via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana cluster is accessed via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server.\nSolana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nStep 1. Open your MetaMask wallet and in the upper-right corner, click the red apple view element.Click Create Account in the dropdown menu and add one more account to interact with the network configured.  \nStep 2. Open your wallet under the new account and click Settings in the dropdown menu.The window with settings menu for selecting a network should open.  \nStep 3. Add the Network choosed and click Add Network in the top-right corner.\n In the window opened fill in the fields (an example of filling them is below):  \n\nNetwork Name - \"remote proxy - solana testnet\"\nNew RPS URL - https://:/solana\nChain ID - 111\nCurrency Symbol - SYM\n\nStep 4. After filling in the field click Save to keep settings. Now you have access to Solana Testnet and can make transactions.\nOption 2: Running Solana Testnet via a proxy hosted locally\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana cluster is accessed via the proxy hosted locally.\nSolana Testnet is used and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nStep 1. Before you start, make sure that you have a daemon running. If you see something like this one:  \n$ docker info\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at . Is the docker daemon running?\n\nthat means you need to run the daemon first.\n$ sudo systemctl start docker\n\nStep 2. Start the proxy and connect it to the Docker network:\n$ sudo docker run --rm -d --network host --name proxy cybercoredev/proxy:latest\n\nThe command line options:\n\n--rm - deleting a container when the command is completed.\n-d - detach a terminal.\n--network host - use host network.\n--name proxy - specifies the proxy name (cybercoredev/proxy:latest - this is the specific image name. The EVM-loader address is registered inside cybercoredev/proxy:latest, so the proxy knows which EVM-loader is running in Solana Testnet).\n\nAs soon as this command is completed, the proxy will be available at http://localhost:9090/solana. This address is set by default. To set a different address, you need to specify the variable -e SOLANA_URL='http://localhost:' on the command line.\nOption 3: Running Solana via a poxy when both are hosted locally\nThe network configuration:\n\nBoth Solana cluster and the proxy hosted locally.\nThe proxy interacts with Solana through the EVM-loader.\n\n$ sudo docker compose app \n\n\n new command will be specified !!!!!!\n\nAs soon as this command is completed, the proxy will be available at http://localhost:9090/solana, Solana will be available at http://localhost:8899.\n"},"devportal/testnet/deploy_contract_via_remix.html":{"url":"devportal/testnet/deploy_contract_via_remix.html","title":"Deploying a Contract via Remix","keywords":"","body":"Deploying Smart Contracts on Solana Testnet via Remix\nThis tutorial will show you step by step how to use Remix and Metamask to create and deploy a simple smart contract on Solana's Testnet.\nRequirements\nBefore you start, make sure that the following requirements are met:\n\nThe MetaMask wallet must be installed on your device.  \nYou must provide online access to remix.ethereum.org to use the Remix - Ethereum IDE open source web application.\nMetaMask wallet must be configured for both Proxy and EVM-loader (regardless of how Proxy and EVM-loader are started, MetaMask wallet must always be configured for them).\n\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana cluster is accessed via a proxy.\nSolana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nSteps to complete\nSet the Remix environment\nStep 1. In order for Remix to be used to load a smart contract into the EVM-loader, Remix must be connected to your MetaMask wallet and run in Injected Web3 environment.Go to http://remix.ethereum.org/ and open the Remix - Ethereum IDE web application. In the left side menu select the File explorers, it is the second button. The FILE EXPLOPERS menu should be active.At Environment field, choose Injected Web3to connect to localhost. (Fig. 1).  \n    \n Fig. 1 - Connecting to localhost   \n\nCreate a simple smart contract at Remix\nStep 2. Click on the icon Create New File and type the file name in the field that appears below it. Let it be the smart contract named helloWorld.solFor now, it is an empty file. To fill it with content, click on the created file name and type the text on the right side of the explorer (or copy your pre-prepared text there)(Fig. 2).  \n    \n Fig. 2 - Loading the helloWorld smart contract   \n\nCompile a smart contract\nStep 3. In the left side menu select the Solidity compiler, it is the third button. The SOLIDITY COMPILER menu will be active.Click on the Compile helloWorld.sol button to compile the loaded smart contract helloWorld (Fig. 3).  \n    \n Fig. 3 - Compiling helloWorld smart contract   \n\nIf the compilation is successful, a green icon will appear near the third button.You can also get detailed information about the compilation process by clicking the Compilation Details button (Fig. 4).  \n    \n Fig. 4 - Compilation Details   \n\nConnect Remix to MetaMask\nStep 4. Interaction with the EVM-loader is carried out through MetaMask. Choose the Injected Web3 environment to connect Remix with an active account in Metamask (Fig. 5).  \n    \n Fig. 5 -Injected Web3 connects Remix with an active account in Metamask   \n\nThe MetaMask window should appear. It should display a list of available accounts (in our case, only one account will be displayed). Choose this account and click Next (Fig. 6).  \n    \n Fig. 6 - Selecting an account to interact with Remix   \n\nClick Connect button to connect to this account (Fig. 7).  \n    \n Fig. 7   \n\nDeploy a smart contract at Solana Testnet\nStep 5. In the left side menu select the Deploy & run transactions, it is the fourth button. The DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS menu will be active.In our case there is only one smart contract to deploy. Therefore, it is automatically selected from dropdown and Remix will automatically generate a transaction.The Account field will display the amount of the wallet account. This data is taken from MetaMask.Click the Deploy button (Fig. 8).  \n    \n Fig. 8 - Deploying the smart contract   \n\nStep 6.

Wei is a denomination of ETH and there are 1e+18 wei per ETH.\ncodeHash â€“ this hash refers to the code of an account on the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). This EVM code cannot be changed unlike the other account fields. For externally owned accounts, the codeHash field is the hash of an empty string.\nstorageRoot â€“ it is known as a storage hash. A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia trie that encodes the storage contents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values. This trie encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.\n\nExternally-owned accounts\nAn account is made up of a cryptographic pair of keys: public and private. They help prove that a transaction was actually signed by the sender and prevent forgeries. Your private key is what you use to sign transactions, so it grants you custody over the funds associated with your account. You never really hold cryptocurrency, you hold private keys â€“ the funds are always on Ethereum's ledger.\nAccount creation\nWhen you have to create an account most libraries will generate you a random private key.A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.  \nExample:ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff48a03bbfd25e8cd036415febaaedce6a  \nThe public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. To get a public address for your account, you need to add `0x ' before the last 20 bytes of the public key.\nContract accounts\nContract accounts have a 42 character hexadecimal address:  \nExample:0x02042f8cf97ae237070f9587f8e7a266dbead5de  \nThe contract address is given when a contract is deployed to the Ethereum Blockchain. The address comes from the creator's address and the number of transactions sent from that address (the nonce)  \n\nNoteAn account is not a wallet.

The account initiates a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Ethereum transaction refers to an action initiated by an external account, i.e. an account managed by a person, not a contract.  \nA transaction, which changes the state of the EVM, needs to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM. Transactions require a fee and must be mined to become valid.\nWhat is in a transaction?\nA submitted transaction includes the following information:\n\nrecipient â€“ the receiving address.\nsignature â€“ the identifier of the sender (sender's signature with a private key).\nvalue â€“ amount of ETH to transfer from sender to recipient.\ndata â€“ (optional field) arbitrary data.\ngasLimit â€“ the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction.\ngasPrice â€“ the fee the sender pays per unit of gas.\n\nWhat is important to remember?\n\nThe block that your transaction is placed in can also contain many other transactions. Checking such a block for the validity of transactions may take a more time. Higher priority transactions are served first.\nIf the network is busy and miners aren't able to keep up, they always prioritise transactions with higher GASPRICE because they get to keep the fees.\nA transaction gets a block confirmation number. This is the number of blocks created since the block that this transaction was included in. The higher the number, the greater the certainty that the transaction was processed and recognised by the network.

This links blocks together (in a chain) because hashes are cryptographically derived from the block data. One change in any block in history will invalidate all the following blocks. This feature protects the blocks in a chain from tampering.  \nTo preserve the transaction history, blocks are strictly ordered (every new block created contains a reference to its parent block), and transactions within blocks are strictly ordered as well.\nWhat is in a block?\n\nTimestamp â€“ the time when the block was mined.\nBlock number â€“ the length of the blockchain in blocks.\nDifficulty â€“ the effort required to mine the block.\nmixHash â€“ a unique identifier for that block.\nA parent hash â€“ the unique identifier for the block that came before (this is how blocks are linked in a chain).\nTransactions list â€“ the transactions included in the block.\nState root â€“ the entire state of the system: account balances, contract storage, contract code and account nonces are inside.\nNonce â€“ a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that the block has gone through proof of work.\n\nBlock size\nBlocks themselves are bounded in size.

This is the fuel that allows it to work, just as a car needs gasoline to run.  \nWhat is the Gas?\nGas is a unit of measurement that determines the amount of computational effort required to perform certain operations on the Ethereum network.  \nSince each transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on network.  \nPerforming any operation on Ethereum requires gas consumption. This includes calculations, storing or manipulating data, or transferring tokens, each consuming different amounts of \"gas\" units. As dapp functionality becomes more complex, the number of operations a smart contract performs grows too, and all of them lead to large amounts of gas that must be paid for.\nWhat is the Gas limit?\nGas limit means the maximum amount of gas you are willing to consume on a transaction. A higher gas limit means more computational work can be done while interacting with smart contracts.  \nFor example if you put a gas limit of 50,000 for a simple ETH transfer, the EVM would consume 21,000, and you would get back the remaining 29,000. However, if you specify too little gas say for example, a gas limit of 20,000 for a simple ETH transfer, the EVM will consume your 20,000 gas units attempting to fulfill the txn, but it will not complete. The EVM then reverts any changes, but since 20k gas units worth of work has already been done that gas is consumed.\n\nMore detailsGAS and FEES\n\n"},"software_manuals/foundational_topics/proof-of-work.html":{"url":"software_manuals/foundational_topics/proof-of-work.html","title":"Proof-of-Work","keywords":"","body":"Proof-of-Work\nProof-of-work (PoW) - is a consensus protocol (proof of work completion) that allows the decentralized Ethereum network to come to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions.

It also maintains anonymity and security, since the cryptocurrency is already distributed among the users of the network.  \nUnlike PoW, validators don't need to use significant amounts of computational power because they're selected at random and aren't competing. They don't need to mine blocks; they just need to create blocks when chosen and validate proposed blocks when they're not. This validation is known as attesting.\nThe PoS concept\n\nThe PoS concept states that a person can mine or verify block transactions depending on how many coins he hold. This means that the more bitcoins or altcoins a miner owns, the more mining power he has.\nThe probability of checking a new block is determined by how large the share that a person holds.\nValidators do not receive block rewards.

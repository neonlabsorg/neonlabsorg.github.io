You can use Chrome, Opera, Firefox, or on iOS, Android if youâ€™re a mobile user.  \n\nAlthough this tutorial uses the Ubuntu platform, the instructions provided can be applied to other platforms.  \n\nInstalling the MetaMask wallet\nStep 1. Go to the MetaMask Download page. From there, select any platform you use and follow the instructions to load and install the MetaMask on a browser of your device. (Fig. 1 shows an example of installing the MetaMask on the Chrome browser).  \n    \n Fig. 1 - Loading up the MetaMask \n\nStep 2. The MetaMask is essentially a plugin in the form of an extension to a browser. Therefore, the browser supported MetaMask can get additional features. In the window appeared, click Add extension (Fig. 2).  \n    \n Fig. 2   \n\nWhen the MetaMask extension is installed, a fox's face will appear in the upper left corner of the web browser window - this is the company logo. This means that you have successfully installed MetaMask on your device and can start to use it.\nStep 3. Create a wallet if you don't already have one. The MetaMask will offer a choice of two options for creating an account:  \n\nImport an existing wallet using a 12-word passphrase.\nCreate a new wallet.\n\nGo ahead and click Create a Wallet. On the support page Help Us Improve MetaMask appeared click the I agree button.The password generation form should open on the display. Enter a secret code that must contain at least 8 symbols.A secret phrase will be generated automatically. Write down a secret phrase for backup (preferably not on a device connected to the Internet). Without this phrase, your funds cannot be refunded if your device is damaged or lost. Confirm that you have written them down on the next page.  \nAfter that, you should see your wallet linked to your account.\nSetting up the MetaMask wallet\nYou can use your wallet to interact with the Solana cluster via a proxy server. To do this, you need to configure your wallet to the desired proxy server.Depending on the tasks to be solved, as well as on a location of the proxy and Solana, there are 3 options for setting up the MetaMask wallet:  \n\nOption 1: Both the proxy and Solana are hosted on the remote servers.\nOption 2: The proxy is hosted locally, Solana - on a remote server.\nOption 3 (debug mode): Both the proxy and Solana are hosted locally.\n\nStep 4. In the upper-right corner, click the red apple view element. Select settings from the dropdown menu required to connect to the proxy server (Fig. 3).  \n    \n Fig. 3 - Select Settings from the dropdown menu   \n\nThe dropdown menu elements:\n\nMy Accounts - list of accounts created by your wallet.\nAccount 1 - account of your wallet that was created during the MetaMask installation. This account provides management of your wallet.\nCreate Account - allows you to create one more account to interact with new proxy server. You can cofigure this wallet to interact with multiple proxy servers.\nImport Account - allows you to import your private key generated by another application into this wallet and use it in the future.\nConnect Hardware Wallet - allows you to save the private key to an external device (i.e. flash memory) located outside the network, increases the security of your private key. \nSettings - to change the default values. By default, the wallet is configured for Ethereum addresses, including those that you canâ€™t actually use.\n\nStep 5. Click Settings in the dropdown menu. The window with settings menu for selecting a network should open (Fig. 4).  \n    \n Fig. 4 - Choosing a Network   \n\nStep 6. Add the Network choosed (Fig. 5).  \n    \n Fig. 5 - The Networks menu   \n\nThe window opened contains the settings for the 6 default subnets.

It allows developers to run their own node in a test blockchain and experiment without losing real currency.The mainnet and testnet coins are incompatible with each other. Testnet coins have no value and developers cannot treansfer mainnet coins to testnet. Likewise, they cannot transfer testnet coins to mainnet.\nRequirements to your device\nThe MetaMask wallet must be installed on your device.  \n\nAlthough this tutorial uses the Ubuntu platform, the instructions provided can be applied to other Linux platforms.  \n\nOption 1: Interaction with Solana Testnet via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana claster is accessed via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server.\nSolana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nStep 1. Open your MetaMask wallet and in the upper-right corner, click the red apple view element.Click Create Account in the dropdown menu and add one more account to interact with the network configured.  \nStep 2. Open your wallet under the new account and click Settings in the dropdown menu.The window with settings menu for selecting a network should open.  \nStep 3. Add the Network choosed and click Add Network in the top-right corner.\n In the window opened fill in the fields (an example of filling them is below):  \n\nNetwork Name - \"remote proxy - solana testnet\"\nNew RPS URL - https://:/solana\nChain ID - 111\nCurrency Symbol - SYM\n\nStep 4. After filling in the field click Save to keep settings. Now you have access to Solana Testnet and can make transactions.\nOption 2: Running Solana Testnet via a proxy hosted locally\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana claster is accessed via the proxy hosted locally.\nSolana Testnet is used and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nStep 1. Before you start, make sure that you have a daemon running. If you see something like this one:  \n$ docker info\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at . Is the docker daemon running?\n\nthat means you need to run the daemon first.\n$ sudo systemctl start docker\n\nStep 2. Start the proxy and connect it to the Docker network:\n$ sudo docker run --rm -d --network host --name proxy cybercoredev/proxy:latest\n\nThe command line options:\n\n--rm - deleting a container when the command is completed.\n-d - detach a terminal.\n--network host - use host network.\n--name proxy - specifies the proxy name (cybercoredev/proxy:latest - this is the specific image name. The EVM-loader address is registered inside cybercoredev/proxy:latest, so the proxy knows which EVM-loader is running in Solana Testnet).\n\nAs soon as this command is completed, the proxy will be available at http://localhost:9090/solana. This address is set by default. To set a different address, you need to specify the variable -e SOLANA_URL='http://localhost:' on the command line.\nOption 3: Running Solana via a poxy when both are hosted locally\nThe network configuration:\n\nBoth Solana claster and the proxy hosted locally.\nThe proxy interacts with Solana through the EVM-loader.\n\n$ sudo docker compose app \n\n\n new command will be specified !!!!!!\n\nAs soon as this command is completed, the proxy will be available at http://localhost:9090/solana, Solana will be available at http://localhost:8899.\n"},"devportal/testnet/deploy_contract_via_remix.html":{"url":"devportal/testnet/deploy_contract_via_remix.html","title":"Deploying a Contract via Remix","keywords":"","body":"Deploying Smart Contracts on Solana Testnet via Remix\nThis tutorial will show you step by step how to use Remix and Metamask to create and deploy a simple smart contract on Solana's Testnet.\nRequirements\nBefore you start, make sure that the following requirements are met:\n\nThe MetaMask wallet must be installed on your device.  \nYou must provide online access to remix.ethereum.org to use the Remix - Ethereum IDE open source web application.\nMetaMask wallet must be configured for both Proxy and EVM-loader (regardless of how Proxy and EVM-loader are started, MetaMask wallet must always be configured for them).\n\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana claster is accessed via a proxy.\nSolana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nSteps to complete\nSet the Remix environment\nStep 1. In order for Remix to be used to load a smart contract into the EVM-loader, Remix must be connected to your MetaMask wallet and run in Injected Web3 environment.Go to http://remix.ethereum.org/ and open the Remix - Ethereum IDE web application.

This trie encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.\n\nExternally-owned accounts\nAn account is made up of a cryptographic pair of keys: public and private. They help prove that a transaction was actually signed by the sender and prevent forgeries. Your private key is what you use to sign transactions, so it grants you custody over the funds associated with your account. You never really hold cryptocurrency, you hold private keys â€“ the funds are always on Ethereum's ledger.\nAccount creation\nWhen you have to create an account most libraries will generate you a random private key.A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.  \nExample:ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff48a03bbfd25e8cd036415febaaedce6a  \nThe public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.

Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM. Transactions require a fee and must be mined to become valid.\nWhat is in a transaction?\nA submitted transaction includes the following information:\n\nrecipient â€“ the receiving address.\nsignature â€“ the identifier of the sender (sender's signature with a private key).\nvalue â€“ amount of ETH to transfer from sender to recipient.\ndata â€“ (optional field) arbitrary data.\ngasLimit â€“ the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction.\ngasPrice â€“ the fee the sender pays per unit of gas.\n\nWhat is important to remember?\n\nThe block that your transaction is placed in can also contain many other transactions.

Gas refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on network.  \nPerforming any operation on Ethereum requires gas consumption. This includes calculations, storing or manipulating data, or transferring tokens, each consuming different amounts of \"gas\" units. As dapp functionality becomes more complex, the number of operations a smart contract performs grows too, and all of them lead to large amounts of gas that must be paid for.\nWhat is the Gas limit?\nGas limit means the maximum amount of gas you are willing to consume on a transaction. A higher gas limit means more computational work can be done while interacting with smart contracts.  \nFor example if you put a gas limit of 50,000 for a simple ETH transfer, the EVM would consume 21,000, and you would get back the remaining 29,000. However, if you specify too little gas say for example, a gas limit of 20,000 for a simple ETH transfer, the EVM will consume your 20,000 gas units attempting to fulfill the txn, but it will not complete.

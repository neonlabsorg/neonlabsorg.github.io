EVM makes the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and efficient and enables developers to build and deploy dApps. Contracts are treated as autonomous scripts or stateful dApps that are stored in the Ethereum blockchain for later execution by the EVM.  \nEthereum has a large number of developer tools (such as Metamask, Remix, Truffle, and others) available in its ecosystem. The toolkit allows users to write dApps in Solidity that is most convenient for the development of contracts.  \nEthereum is the flagship of the crypto world. It runs a lot of distributed applications that have proven themselves in a market and are in demand all over the world.\nThe key Solana capabilities\nSolana is an exceptionally fast, secure, and inexpensive blockchain network.The Solana blockchain provides:\n\nhigh performance, including:\nshort block processing time,\nprocessing a large number of transactions per second (transactions can be executed in parallel),\n\n\nlow transaction fees;\nincreasing the number of nodes in the network without reducing the performance of the network as a whole;\nbuilding-in your language a code in C, C++, Rust, and Move.\n\nGoal\nTo find a solution that combines the best properties of both Ethereum and Solana and provides:\n\nSolana users with the ability to use the unique Ethereum toolkits to write dApps in Solidity.\nThe ability for Ethereum dApps to be deployed on Solana to attract a huge audience of Ethereum users to the Solana blockchain.\nEthereum users with the ability to use the unique Solana properties. This allows users to significantly increase the speed of transactions and reduce the fee charged for their execution.\n\nSolution implemented\nTo achieve the goal, the following solution was proposed and implemented by the NeonLabs development team:\n\nEVM was moved to Solana and named Neon EVM. This was an emulator implemented using Rust. The Neon EVM operated inside Solana providing parallel transaction processing and a low transaction fee.\nThe Neon Web3 Proxy component was created to mediate interactions between the Ethereum user (account) and the Neon EVM. The main function of Proxy was to provide an API for external clients.\n\nSolution in detail\nThe block diagram of the solution is shown in Fig. 1.  \n    \n Fig. 1   \n\nBerkley Packed FilterThe BPF virtual machine is installed in Solana. The BPF allows developers to embed other virtual machines inside Solana.  \nUsing BPF capabilities, the EVM virtual machine was loaded inside Solana. That is, a contract called Neon EVM was created in Solana, inside of which the EVM was loaded.  \nBecause Solana has a contract update mechanism, the Neon EVM contract can also be updated independently of the update of the Solana node itself. This allows developers to update EVM versions for their various needs without updating all the blockchain nodes.  \nNeon Web3 ProxyA user is allowed to form transactions under an Ethereum account and sign them with a public key generated in Ethereum. Formed transactions according to Ethereum rules are sent to the input of the Proxy component. This component converts N-trxs into transactions under the Solana rules.  \nAn N-trx size can exceed the maximum S-trx size. Also, the amount of resources that a S-trx can spend is limited. Converting a transaction in a one-to-one format is difficult due to the possible lack of resources. Therefore, it was decided to generate multiple S-trxs for one N-trx.\nEach generated transaction is signed with a Proxy key. Proxy sends the generated batch of transactions to Solana.  \nWeb3 APIProxy provides the full Web3 API to interact with external clients. In Ethereum, some contracts work at the blockchain level, and there is also an API that is supported by an Ethereum node. Clients that are created for Ethereum contracts support standard interfaces. For a client (i.e. Metamask, Remix) to work in a web browser, it must work via the Web3 API. That is, the written client parts do not need to be rewritten again. Clients will work on a different blockchain if they are provided with the same interface. To do this, you just need to change the address where these clients need to go. Ethereum contracts and clients do not need to be rewritten to work in Solana, you just need to register the Proxy address. Any client can run a Proxy to deploy a contract inside Solana. Clients will work as they did before.\nNeon EVMSolana runs BPF, inside of which Neon EVM also runs. Neon EVM is a Solana contract, so it recognizes the transaction format from the received batch. Neon EVM extracts data from each transaction and thus can retrieve all the original user information placed in the transaction.  \nNeon EWM also validates a signature that is in the transaction. If the signature is authentic, Neon EVM takes the contract code to which this transaction is addressed and starts to execute it. As soon as the contract code has been executed successfully, Neon EVM fixes a new state.For example, if it is a token transfer, the contract code sends tokens from one account to another. Neon EVM simply fixes this new state.  \nThe user can also form a transaction to load a contract inside Neon EVM. In this case, the contract code will be written for Ethereum. A bytecode of this contract code will be loaded inside Neon EVM. That is, the contract itself and its data will be stored inside Solana.\nAccount Data StorageSolana contains storage of accounts. Neon EVM has access to this storage and uses the account data. After registering an account in Solana, its data is placed in this storage. Ethereum accounts are also stored here but in the Solana representation.  For each Ethereum address, there is a corresponding account in the Solan representation. A contract code is placed in a corresponding account of this storage. \nNeon EVM interacts with a set of data that is stored on Solana's accounts. Neon EVM can take from there a contract code using the corresponding account address to validate a transaction. Neon EVM contains a virtual machine inside it that runs according to Ethereum rules.\nHow Neon works\nA user calls a client that generates a transaction and sends it to the Proxy, inside which the Neon EVM emulator runs (Fig. 2). The transaction formed in accordance with the Ethereum rules contain mandatory fields, including:\n\nNonce - the number of transactions sent from the current address;\nSignature â€“ this is generated in accordance with the Ethereum rules;\nGas price - the fee the sender pays per unit of gas;\nGas limit - the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction;\nValue - amount of coins to transfer from sender to a recipient;\nRecipient - an address of a recipient.\n\n    \n Fig. 2   \n\nTo perform this transaction, the Neon EVM emulator makes a request to Solana to get state data.\nProxy requests a blockchain state from Solana and makes a test launch of N-trx using the Solana state. On the basis of the data received, Proxy forms the new transaction according to Solana's rules. The transaction generated for Solana will contain the packaged N-trx, as well as the account data required to complete the transaction, including: \n\npayer - the account that pays for the transaction;\nother accounts involved in the execution of this transaction.  \n\nNext, the transaction is forwarded inside Solana, where participants of the transaction are determined according to the account data. The data added includes details about persons who initiate and take part in processing the transaction. The operator of Proxy is specified as a payer. The payer will be rewarded for completing the transaction.  \nNext, the transaction is transferred to Neon EVM, where its signature is checked according to Ethereum rules. If the signature is valid, the transaction will be transferred to the Solana blockchain for execution. Since testing of N-trx is made, it is possible to provide Solana with all the necessary information to parallelize the execution of the N-trx.\nConclusion\nThe developed solution gives users the following features:\n\nNo changes or additional resources are required to implement dApps on Solana.\nNo need to rewrite clients for all existing dApps, since the Ethereum node interface remains unchanged, and therefore clients can run on the Solana node also without changes.\nNo need to rewrite contracts for existing dApps.\nSolana developers are given the opportunity to:\nuse a unique toolkit created for Ethereum;\ncreate and deploy their contracts on the Solana network.\n\n\nUnlike Ethereum, the Neon EVM can be updated at any time. This means that new functionality can be added at any time and code updates can take place simply by uploading them as a new smart contract.\n\n"},"devportal/neon_evm_arch.html":{"url":"devportal/neon_evm_arch.html","title":"Overview of the Neon EVM architecture","keywords":"","body":"Overview of the Neon EVM Architecture\n\nThis section describes the architectural solutions built into the Neon EVM that enable fast transaction processing for an Ethereum user. It also describes the ways of passing tokens from the user to the final consumer.\n\nGeneral about the problem being solved\nFor a user's transaction to be executed quickly, it must be finalized quickly. Therefore, the main task for the Neon EVM developers is to ensure the prompt finalization of a transaction. Also, solutions should be developed to ensure the creation of liquid tokens by Neon EVM users and their circulation within Solana.\nSolution\nThe architectural solution based on Neon EVM is presented in Fig. 1.\n    \n Fig. 1   \n\nBelow are component descriptions of the architectural solution.\nNeon EVM User (or User)This is any user who has an account in Neon EVM with a balance in ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens.  \nSolana transaction (or S-trx)This is a transaction formed according to the Solana network rules with a signature produced by Solana rules.  \nNeon transaction (or N-trx)This is a transaction formed according to Ethereum rules with a signature produced by Ethereum rules.  \nNeon EVM Client (or Client)This is an application that has an EVM (Solidity/Vyper/etc.) bytecode contract loaded into Neon EVM. The application generates a transaction N-trx according to Ethereum rules and sends it to a Proxy. Before sending N-trx, the client transfers funds to the Solana deposit required to cover the costs of an operator.  \nNeon EVM Operator (or Operator)This is a role performed by a Solana account using a software tool. Within Neon EVM, an operator is provided with software in the form of a Proxy to fulfill certain functions. The operator can deploy either one Proxy or several. He can also configure one Proxy for multiple operators, as well as run several Proxy with different settings.  \nNeon Web3 Proxy (or Proxy)This is software using which an operator does his job. Although Proxy is not a mandatory component in the Neon EVM architecture (for example, the Proxy logic can be implemented inside a client's browser), implementing it as a separate component can speed up transaction processing. In the Neon EVM Mainnet, Proxy must provide multithreading to work in parallel.  \nThe Proxy contains an EVM emulator that pre-tests the execution of the transaction. This testing determines the number of coins required on the operator's balance, as well as the current rate of SOL and ETH. This is so that there is economic motivation. Taking this into account that each operator configures a Proxy assigned to it at his discretion.  \nProxy converts N-trx into transactions under the Solana rules. N-trx is signed by a user, while S-trxs are signed by an operator. A separate account is created in Solana, to which the Neon transaction text is loaded from the received S-trxs. Neon EVM receives a command to execute the transaction located at this account address.  \nBelow is a list of the main Neon Web3 Proxy features that are implemented in the Neon EVM Testnet:\n\nReceiving requests over Web3 API protocol.\nShaping responses using Web3 API protocol.\nPackaging a Neon transaction into a Solana transaction. The Solana transaction contains the following information:\nThe Neon EVM operator account from which the amount in SOL tokens should be withdrawn for execution.\nThe Neon EVM operator account where a payment is sent for the job done in tokens specified by the user.\nThe Neon EVM account to deposit funds to be spent for iterative execution of a transaction.\nList of accounts participating in the execution of Neon transactions (formed according to Solana rules).\nThe number of steps per iteration of a Neon transaction (see the section on iterative execution of Neon transactions).\n\n\nExecuting read-only Solidity methods of contracts.\nProviding a method for linking accounts from SPL-token contracts to ERC20. SPL-wrapper to access SPL-token contracts via Neon transactions.\nProviding a user with a method to switch a token to be used for gas payment.\nProviding a user with a method to execute an Neon transaction without a test run.\n\nNeon EVMThis is an Ethereum Virtual Machine compiled into Berkeley Packet Filter bytecode of a virtual machine running on Solana. Neon EVM is configured using a multisig EVM account that looks like a decentralized Neon EVM governance. Participants of the multisig EVM account (actors) can change the Neon EVM code and set up Neon EVM parameters.  \nNeon EVM Governance ParticipantThe fuctions performed by the Governance participants:\n\nupdating contracts;\nadding functionality;\nelimination of shortcomings of the program code;\nchanging parameters in the settings (the fee value, opening new balance, the Mn value, the max number of iterations, etc.).  \n\nERC20 TKNThis is a contract based on the ERC20 standard token. ERC20 Token shows user balances for a certain ticker. After an account (user-acc) selects a type of token, this contract becomes blocked.  \nSPL TokenSPL Token (Solana Program Library Token) is a contract containing a system register of tokens that are in the system along with the Solana balances of their users. The contract implements the ERC20 interface - this is a description of the basic set of functions that the contract must support. An operation of transferring funds is possible only with a contract that supports this interface.  \nSolanaThis is a blockchain containing a stream of blocks. It stores a block-log of completed operations. It also contains the current Solana state, where the results of transactions, accounts, and public keys are stored. There are also 2 balances: the first one with the ETH token and the second one with the token with which a transaction will be paid.  \nERC20 WrapperThis is a separate contract developed based on the ERC20 standard. It contains maps with user balances. Although this contract is hosted inside Neon EVM, it is independent.  \nA user can create a contract supporting the ERC20 standard for a specific token and generate the required number of tokens (coins). These tokens will only be liquid within Neon EVM. For these coins to be liquid in Solana, the SPL Token and ERC20 TKN contracts must be interoperable. This function is performed by the ERC20 Wrapper contract.\nEconomic Game as a means of stimulating operators\nThe processing of a transaction is conventionally divided into several steps (iterations). Depending on the number of operations required to complete the transaction, the number of steps may vary. The next step starts only after the previous step is successfully completed (Fig. 2).\n    \n Fig. 2   \n\nA transaction will be considered successfully completed if the Final step finishes. The execution of the transaction should not go beyond the allotted number of Mn blocks. This means that the operations performed at all steps must be completed within the Mn period, otherwise, the transaction is considered uncompleted.  \nA user who forms a transaction indicates in it an operator (Proxy) that will be responsible for its execution. Each operator has a deposit account in Neon EVM. These accounts belong to Neon EVM, so no one can withdraw funds from the deposit until the finalization step is completed. Before processing a transaction, Neon EVM debits the amount of funds from the operator account (op-acc) and transfers them to the operator's deposit (dep-acc).  \nIf for any reason (for example, due to a lack of funds on a deposit), an operation is not performed at a step, the next operator starts processing this transaction from the current step. This operator does not deposit any funds for the remaining steps. If he also does not complete all of the remaining steps, this process is passed to the next operator. At the Final step, a transaction is created to withdraw funds from the deposit in full, including a remainder, and credit them to the operator who completed this step. This implementation obliges not only the client, but also any operator involved in processing the transaction, to be interested in its successful completion.  \nExampleStep 1 - transferring funds to a deposit.Step 2 - blocking an account.Steps - other actions.Final - the deposit is returned to the operator's account (op acc). Results of the transaction have already been reflected in Solana State.  \nIn the Neon EVM settings, there is a limit on the number of blocks (Mn) during which a transaction must be completed. By default, the Mn value is 1 (that is, a transaction must be completed during the processing of one block). There is also a limit on the number of steps (the maximum number of iterations) to complete a transaction.\nThe values Mn and number of iterations are set by a Multisig account. The number of steps is also limited by funds on a user's balance.  \nAt every step, the Continue operation checks if this is the last step in the transaction execution or not.\nHow does an operator know about the appearance of a transaction that can be continued?\nSolana's entire history is stored in Solana State. Using this history, the operator can obtain the necessary information about all transactions related to Neon EVM. The Proxy can track incomplete transactions in this history, that can be continued by another operator. The operator who can continue to execute the unfinished transaction must first re-sign it with his key. If the number of blocks does not exceed Mn since the start of transaction processing by the previous operator, the signature of that operator is kept. If the number of blocks exceeds Mn, the transaction can be re-signed by any operator.\nSpecial cases\nCase 1. One of the initial and mandatory operations is blocking an account, that is, the execution of other transactions is blocked for this time.For example, to go from step 1 to step 2 (see Fig.2), operator 1 must process Mn blocks. During this time, the Continue operation will not be available to other operators. If operator 1 is unable to complete a transaction during the processing of Mn blocks, this transaction remains incomplete. The funds on the balance are burned out.Therefore, every operator is interested in using high-speed resources.  \nCase 2. A transaction cannot be completed if an error occurs.If step 1 is completed, and Cancel occurred in step 2, the funds are not returned to an operator. He cannot withdraw funds from a client for partial execution of a transaction. The funds are also not returned to the client. In this case, the funds on the deposit will be burned. To don't lose funds, the operator is interested in completing the transaction in full, and not in part.  \nCase 3. Before executing a transaction, funds are checked on the user's balance, including the exceeding Gas Limit. If a shortage of funds happens on some step, the transaction is fixed as a Fail. Funds are debited from the user's account and transferred to the operator's account.  \nTransferring tokens inside Solana\nA special dApp (this is a contract) with its token balances was created in ERC20 Wrapper. Application users know the address of this dApp. To transfer funds, they need to contact this dApp address specifying an account and the number of funds to transfer. The transfer will be done within this contract.  \nThe interaction between SPL Token and ERC20 TKN is shown in Fig.3.  \n    \n Fig. 3   \n\nThere are 2 user balances: User SPL Balance, whose tokens are traded within Solana, and User ERC20 Balance, whose tokens are traded within the Neon EVM. The ERC20 Wrapper allows a user to transfer his SPL tokens on the ERC20 Balance, exchange them for tokens he needs and withdraw them back. Thus, a user can create a token inside Neon EVM and transfer any number of coins from User SPL Balance to User ERC20 Balance. Then, using EVM contracts, he can handle these coins.\nPossible formation of a queue of payments and solution to this issue\nIssue descriptionLet the ERC20 TKN contract contain only one map for all users with their balances. Then the following conflict situation is possible: if the majority of users pay with ETH tokens, then the same contract will appear inside each N-trx, within which the value will need to be changed. This will cause all N-trxs to line up in one queue and they cannot be executed in parallel.  \nThe reason would be that: at the final step, funds would be transferred from the user's balance to the operator's balance within one contract.  \nThe solutionThe default token type field along with the balance is added to the Neon account. This field will allow a user to select a type of token for payment using the special option. To transfer SPL tokens from outside to an operator's account, the ERC20 wrapper is used.  \nThe Neon client does not have an option to select a type of token for payment and can only operate with ETH. Therefore, the storage of funds is implemented in the user's Solana State. The Neon account (user-acc) has a separate field that specifies the type of token. After a user specifies a type of token, this type will be indicated in the account field of this user. Having this information, Solana can turn to ERC20 wrapper to convert tokens.  \nAn operator will create a deposit account for the transaction. It is possible to create a pool of such deposit accounts, so that the ERC20 Wrapper logic will select the desired transaction from this pool, and thereby not create a queue for the payment of funds to the operator.  \nTransferring tokens between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains\nERC20 Wrapper allows a user to manipulate balances inside SPL Token. The user runs his application inside Neon EVM with logic that releases new coins. To transfer these coins to the outside world, he needs to use the ERC20 Bridge implementation. Inside Neon EVM, these coins will be blocked and transferred inside SPL Token to different addresses. They will become liquid inside Solana, but under a different token name, which is registered inside Solana.  \nA user also can transfer part of the funds to his balance inside Neon EVM and convert them into a new token using a token exchange algorithm chosen by him.  \nFig. 4 shows the scheme for transferring tokens between Solana and Ethereum.  \n    \n Fig. 4   \n\nEthereum tokens are generated in accordance with the ERC20 standard. Therefore, to transfer tokens between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, a separate ERC20 Wrapper must be deployed for each Solana token. The task of the ERC20 Wrapper is to ensure the interaction of the Solana applications with EVM (Solidity/Vyper/etc.) bytecode contracts, as well as to transfer funds in Solana tokens using Ethereum wallets such as Metamask.  \nThe main interacting component in the toking transfer is the ERC20 Bridge, which is a separate contract. When itâ€™s called, it generates a Solana token which represents the corresponding ERC20 token in the SPL Token contract. The Solana tokens registered in the SPL Token contract can be transferred to Solana contracts.  \nBridge operators are responsible for the ERC20 Bridge operation. They get fees from the conversion of tokens.\n"},"devportal/value_token.html":{"url":"devportal/value_token.html","title":"Transaction Value Token","keywords":"","body":"Transaction Value Token as an Analogue of ETH for Neon EVM Solutions\n\nThis section contains introductory information about the Transaction Value token (hereinafter Value token), which is analogous to the ETH token in Neon EVM solutions.  \n\nUsing the original ETH token in Neon EVM can create additional difficulties when calculating payment of rewards to transaction participants. Therefore, the Value token is introduced to circulate it inside Neon EVM. This token is analogous to ETH, coming from the Ethereum network through one of the bridges - WormHole or Sollet. Each of these bridges transfers funds (assets) from ETH-token to SPL-token and back.  \nTransfer of funds using bridges is automated, so the converted tokens are directly transferred to Neon EVM. The token conversion scheme is implemented in such a way that it allows transactions to be executed in parallel. Unlike the method of conversion through ERC20 tokens (this method is used in Ethereum, where a map is used with accounts inside a contract), this scheme does not allow transactions to line up in one queue.  \n    \n\nStoring balances inside Neon EVM\nInside Neon EVM is the Ethereum account. For each user, the Ethereum account contains two fields for storing two types of coins:\n\nETH (or USDT) - a coin identifier, which is a Value token;\nPAYMENT - a token to pay for transactions. Each user can create the token, with which he will pay with the operator for transactions.\n\nPart of the Ethereum account code should work with ETH and the other part with PAYMENT.  \nThe Solana account is outside Neon EVM and is built as a program address of the Ethereum account. Therefore, only the Ethereum account can access the Solana account. The Solana account contains a balance in SPL tokens. All operations with a Value token are performed through an appeal to the SPL token. This balance is built in a certain fixed way according to the Ethereum account address and the Neon EVM program address. Therefore, only the Solana account can access this balance.  \nSince only a specific Ethereum account can access the Solana account, only this Ethereum account can also access the Solana account balance.  \nWhen funds are transferring between users, an SPL token is requested, and it transfers funds from one balance to another. Users' balances are stored in their accounts. This placement of balances eliminates the appearance of a queue for processing transactions.\nNeon EVM contains the ERC20 contract. This contract provides work with the balances of Solana's accounts from inside the Solidity contract.\nCreating an Ethereum account\nAs soon as an Ethereum account is created, it is automatically built an SPL token balance for a specific user. This operation can only be done by Neon EVM since only it has authorization to perform an operation from the program-account address (Solana account).  \nAfter the Ethereum account is created, it becomes possible to send a Value token to the contract to a user's balance, that is, to process transfers made from the contract code.\nPayment for execution of a transaction\nA user has the ability to choose a token to pay to an operator for completing a transaction.\nTo do this, the user creates an account in Neon EVM, where he can transfer ETH tokens through a bridge to pay for transactions. Automatically, he gets a balance in the SPL token.  \n\nTransferring ETH (or USDT) tokens through one bridge (for example, through WormHole) will not be equivalent to transferring the same tokens through another bridge (for example, through Sollet). This means that the user cannot withdraw ETH tokens from his balance through one bridge (WormHole), if these tokens were transferred to this balance through another bridge (Sollet).  \n\nThen the user can make transactions inside Neon EVM. Since a coroutine address is linked to the user's balance, no one except this coroutine address can use this token.\nToken circulation\nWhen a user creates a transaction, he specifies a cost of its execution, taking into account the gas price. An operator gets the transaction for execution taking into account the cost specified by the user, as well as a fee. The user's funds are blocked and in the future they will be paid to an operator.  \nUser funds are transferred to the collateral pool in the form of SOL tokens. The amount of tokens depends on setting a multisig account (in the current implementation, this value is hardcoded).  \nDepending on the number of operations in a transaction, it can be performed in one or several iterations.\nToken circulation, when a transaction is executed in one iteration\nBefore executing a transaction, an operator transfers funds to the Neon token collateral pool. At the same time, he pays a fee to the validator for checking signatures and pays rent for storing data on the balance of the account.  \nAfter the transaction is completed, PAYMENT tokens are transferred from the user's balance to the operator's balance to cover his costs.\nToken circulation, when a transaction is executed in multiple iterations\nUnlike a non-iterative transaction, the payment of funds to operators is added to motivate them, that is, to interest them in a faster execution of a transaction. This is done so that the accounts involved in the process are not blocked for a long time.  \nAt the start of an iterative transaction, an operator transfers a fee to the collateral pool, as well as funds (SOL tokens) to a special deposit account. The funds in this account will be paid to the operator who completes the transaction.  The fee will be paid for execution costs over multiple iterations.  \nThe priority to receive funds from a deposit is given to the operator who sent the transaction for execution.  \nA transaction contains the name of the operator that is executing it. Also, the transaction indicates the block number when the last activity of this operator was. If fewer blocks have passed than the hardcoded value of the blocks, then this operator can continue the transaction. Only the operator specified in it can cancel the transaction. If more blocks have passed, then any operator can continue the transaction. The right to execute the transaction passes to the operator that intercepts this execution, that is, who is ahead of the others.  \nThe right for withdrawing funds from a deposit is granted to the operator who performs the final step. At this step, the user's funds are transferred to the deposit.  \nIf for some reason a transaction is canceled (using the Cancel operation), the blocked funds of a user are returned to him back. The deposit that was frozen is burned. No payout is made to operators. This is done so that operators are interested in completing the transaction.  \n"},"devportal/metamask_setup.html":{"url":"devportal/metamask_setup.html","title":"Installing and Setting up MetaMask","keywords":"","body":"Installing and Setting up MetaMask\nMetaMask wallet is a convenient and fairly easy-to-use application for storing Ethereum addresses and private keys.\nGoal\nTo install the MetaMask on your device to connect the wallet to the Solana Testnet environment.  \nRequirements to your device\nA browser-supported the MetaMask must be loaded on your device.

It allows developers to run their node in a test blockchain and experiment without losing real currency.The mainnet and testnet coins are incompatible with each other. Testnet coins have no value and developers cannot treansfer mainnet coins to testnet. Likewise, they cannot transfer testnet coins to mainnet.\nRequirements for your device\nThe MetaMask wallet must be installed on your device.  \n\nAlthough this tutorial uses the Ubuntu platform, the instructions provided can be applied to other Linux platforms.  \n\nOption 1: Interaction with Solana Testnet via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana cluster is accessed via a proxy hosted on a remote virtual server.\nSolana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nStep 1. Open your MetaMask wallet and in the upper-right corner, click the red apple view element.Click Create Account in the dropdown menu and add one more account to interact with the network configured.  \nStep 2. Open your wallet under the new account and click Settings in the dropdown menu.The window with a settings menu for selecting a network should open.  \nStep 3.

After filling in the field click Save to keep settings. Now you have access to Solana Testnet and can make transactions.\nOption 2: Running Solana Testnet via a proxy hosted locally\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana cluster is accessed via the proxy hosted locally.\nSolana Testnet is used and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nStep 1. Before you start, make sure that you have a daemon running. If you see something like this one:  \n$ docker info\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at . Is the docker daemon running?\n\nthat means you need to run the daemon first.\n$ sudo systemctl start docker\n\nStep 2. Start the proxy and connect it to the Docker network:\n$ sudo docker run --rm -d --network host --name proxy cybercoredev/proxy:latest\n\nThe command line options:\n\n--rm - deleting a container when the command is completed.\n-d - detach a terminal.\n--network host - use host network.\n--name proxy - this specifies the proxy name (cybercoredev/proxy:latest - this is the specific image name. The EVM-loader address is registered inside cybercoredev/proxy:latest, so the proxy knows which EVM-loader is running in Solana Testnet).\n\nAs soon as this command is completed, the proxy will be available at http://localhost:9090/solana. This address is set by default. To set a different address, you need to specify the variable -e SOLANA_URL='http://localhost:' on the command line.  \nWhen a proxy is deployed, it generates a wallet containing a key pair. If you do not need the new wallet and want to use the keys you already have, then you need to specify the path to your wallet on the command line. In this case, the poxy will not create a new key pair. The command line will look like this one:  \n$ sudo docker run --rm -d --network host -v ~/.config/solana/id.json:/root/.config/solana/id.json --name proxy cybercoredev/proxy:latest\n\nThe parameter ~/.config/solana/id.json - specifies the path to your key pair.\nOption 3: Running Solana via a poxy when both are hosted locally\nThe network configuration:\n\nBoth the Solana cluster and the proxy are hosted locally.\nThe proxy interacts with Solana through the EVM-loader.\n\n$ sudo docker compose app \n\n\n The new command will be specified !!!!!!\n\nAs soon as this command is completed, the proxy will be available at http://localhost:9090/solana, Solana will be available at http://localhost:8899.\n"},"devportal/testnet/deploy_contract_via_remix.html":{"url":"devportal/testnet/deploy_contract_via_remix.html","title":"Deploying a Contract via Remix","keywords":"","body":"Deploying Smart Contracts on Solana Testnet via Remix\nThis tutorial will show you step by step how to use Remix and Metamask to create and deploy a simple smart contract on Solana's Testnet.\nRequirements\nBefore you start, make sure that the following requirements are met:\n\nThe MetaMask wallet must be installed on your device.  \nYou must provide online access to remix.ethereum.org to use the Remix - Ethereum IDE open source web application.\nMetaMask wallet must be configured for both Proxy and EVM-loader (regardless of how Proxy and EVM-loader are started, MetaMask wallet must always be configured for them).\n\nThe network configuration:\n\nSolana cluster is accessed via a proxy.\nSolana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through the EVM-loader.\n\nSteps to complete\nSet the Remix environment\nStep 1.

A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia trie that encodes the storage contents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values. This trie encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.\n\nExternally-owned accounts\nAn account is made up of a cryptographic pair of keys: public and private. They help prove that a transaction was  signed by the sender and prevent forgeries. Your private key is what you use to sign transactions, so it grants you custody over the funds associated with your account. You never really hold cryptocurrency, you hold private keys â€“ the funds are always on Ethereum's ledger.\nAccount creation\nWhen you have to create an account most libraries will generate you a random private key.A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.  \nExample:ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff48a03bbfd25e8cd036415febaaedce6a  \nThe public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.

The account initiates a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. Ethereum transaction refers to an action initiated by an external account, i.e. an account managed by a person, not a contract.  \nA transaction, which changes the state of the EVM, needs to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM. Transactions require a fee and must be mined to become valid.\nWhat is in a transaction?\nA submitted transaction includes the following information:\n\nrecipient â€“ the receiving address.\nsignature â€“ the identifier of the sender (sender's signature with a private key).\nvalue â€“ amount of coind to transfer from sender to recipient.\ndata â€“ (optional field) arbitrary data.\ngasLimit â€“ the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction.\ngasPrice â€“ the fee the sender pays per unit of gas.\n\nWhat is important to remember?\n\nThe block that your transaction is placed in can also contain many other transactions.

This is the fuel that allows it to work, just as a car needs gasoline to run.  \nWhat is the Gas?\nGas is a unit of measurement that determines the amount of computational effort required to perform certain operations on the Ethereum network.  \nSince each transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on network.  \nPerforming any operation on Ethereum requires gas consumption. This includes calculations, storing or manipulating data, or transferring tokens, each consuming different amounts of \"gas\" units. As dapp functionality becomes more complex, the number of operations a smart contract performs grows too, and all of them lead to large amounts of gas that must be paid for.\nWhat is the Gas limit?\nGas limit means the maximum amount of gas you are willing to consume on a transaction. A higher gas limit means more computational work can be done while interacting with smart contracts.  \nFor example if you put a gas limit of 50,000 for a simple coin transfer, the coins would consume 21,000, and you would get back the remaining 29,000. However, if you specify too little gas say for example, a gas limit of 20,000 for a simple coin transfer, the coins will consume your 20,000 gas units attempting to fulfill the txn, but it will not complete.

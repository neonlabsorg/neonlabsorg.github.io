the Ethereum Virtual Machine\nProxy - Neon Web3 Proxy\nS-trx - transaction formed according to the Solana network rules\n\nKey Ethereum capabilities\nEthereumâ€™s core innovation, EVM, is a Turing-complete software that runs on the Ethereum network. EVM enables developers to build and deploy dApps, making the process of creating blockchain applications much easier and efficient. Contracts are treated as autonomous scripts or stateful dApps that are stored in the Ethereum blockchain for execution by the EVM at a later stage.  \nEthereum has a large number of developer tools (such as Metamask, Remix, Truffle, and others) available in its ecosystem. The toolkit allows users to write dApps in Solidity: the standard language for development of contracts.  \nEthereum is the flagship of the crypto world. It runs a lot of distributed applications that have proven themselves in the market and are in demand all over the world.\nKey Solana capabilities\nSolana is an exceptionally fast, secure, and  relatively inexpensive blockchain network.The Solana blockchain provides:\n\nHigh performance, including:\nShort block processing time.\nProcessing of many transactions per second (transactions can be executed in parallel).\n\n\nLow transaction fees.\nAbility to increase the number of nodes in the network without reducing the performance of the network as a whole.\nCapability to build in coding languages C, C++, Rust.\n\nGoal\nTo find a solution that combines the best of both Ethereum and Solana and allows:\n\nSolana users to use unique Ethereum toolkits to write dApps in Solidity.\nEthereum dApps to be deployed on Solana, thereby attracting a huge audience of Ethereum users to the Solana blockchain.\nEthereum users to significantly increase the speed of transactions and reduce the fee charged for their execution by using Solana.\n\nSolution implemented\nTo achieve the goal, the following solution was proposed and implemented by the NeonLabs development team:\n\nEVM was integrated in Solana and named Neon EVM: an emulator implemented using Rust.\nNeon EVM operates inside Solana providing parallel transaction processing and a low transaction fee.\nThe Neon Web3 Proxy was created to mediate interactions between the Ethereum user (account) and the Neon EVM; the main function of the proxy is to provide an API for external clients.\n\nSolution in detail\nThe block diagram of the solution is shown in Fig. 1.  \n    \n Fig. 1   \n\nBerkeley Packet FilterThe BPF virtual machine is installed in Solana, allowing developers to embed other virtual machines inside Solana.  \nUsing BPF capabilities, a contract called Neon EVM was created in Solana, inside of which the EVM was loaded.  \nBecause Solana has a contract update mechanism, the Neon EVM contract can also be updated independently of updates of the Solana node itself. This allows developers to update EVM versions without updating all the blockchain nodes.  \nNeon Web3 ProxyA user is allowed to form transactions under an Ethereum account and sign them with a public key generated in Ethereum. Transactions formed according to Ethereum rules are sent to the input of the Proxy component. This component converts N-trxs into transactions under Solana rules.  \nThe size of N-trx  can exceed that of S-trx. Also, the amount of resources that a S-trx can spend is limited. Converting a transaction in a one-to-one format is difficult due to the possible lack of resources. Therefore, it was decided to generate multiple S-trxs for one N-trx.\nEach transaction generated is signed with a proxy key. The proxy sends the generated batch of transactions to Solana.  \nWeb3 APIThe proxy provides the full Web3 API to interact with external clients. In Ethereum, some contracts work at the blockchain level, and there is also an API that is supported by an Ethereum node. Clients that are created for Ethereum contracts support standard interfaces. For a client (i.e. Metamask, Remix) to work in a web browser, it must work via the Web3 API. With Neon EVM, Ethereum dApps can be deployed on Solana without any edits to the source code or recompilation: dApps look and function exactly the same.  \nClients will work on a different blockchain if they are provided with the same interface. You can do this by changing the address where these clients need to go. Ethereum contracts and clients do not need to be rewritten to work in Solana, you just need to register the proxy address. Any client can run a proxy to deploy a contract inside Solana. The interface that the clients interact with will be the same as for dApps running on Ethereum.\nNeon EVMSolana runs BPF, inside of which runs Neon EVM. Neon EVM is a Solana contract, so it recognizes the transaction format from the received batch. Neon EVM extracts data from each transaction and thus can retrieve all the original user information placed in the transaction.  \nNeon EVM also validates the signature that is in the transaction. If the signature is authentic, Neon EVM takes the contract code to which this transaction is addressed and starts to execute it. As soon as the contract code has been executed successfully, Neon EVM records a new state.  \nFor example, if the transaction is a token transfer, the contract code sends tokens from one account to another. Neon EVM simply records this new state.  \nThe user can also form a transaction to load a contract inside Neon EVM. In this case, the contract code will be written for Ethereum. A bytecode of this contract code will be loaded inside Neon EVM. That is, the contract itself and its data will be stored inside Solana.\nAccount data storageSolana stores account data. Neon EVM has access to this storage and uses the account data. After registering an account in Solana, the account data is placed in this storage. Ethereum accounts are also stored here but in the Solana representation. For each Ethereum address, there is a corresponding account in the Solana representation. A contract code is placed in a corresponding account of this storage. \nNeon EVM interacts with a set of data that is stored on Solana's accounts. Neon EVM can take a contract code from there using the corresponding account address to validate a transaction. Neon EVM contains a virtual machine inside it that runs according to Ethereum rules.\nHow Neon works\nA user calls a client that generates a transaction and sends it to the proxy, inside which the Neon EVM emulator runs (Fig. 2). The transaction is formed in accordance with the Ethereum rules and contains mandatory fields, including:\n\nNonce: number of transactions sent from the current address.\nSignature: generated in accordance with the Ethereum rules.\nGas price: fee the sender pays per unit of gas.\nGas limit: maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction.\nValue: amount of coins to transfer from sender to a recipient.\nRecipient: address of the recipient.\n\n    \n Fig. 2   \n\nTo perform this transaction, the Neon EVM emulator makes a request to Solana to get state data.\nThe proxy requests a blockchain state from Solana and makes a test launch of N-trx using the Solana state. On the basis of the data received, Proxy forms the new transaction according to Solana's rules. The transaction generated for Solana will contain the packaged N-trx, as well as the account data required to complete the transaction, including: \n\nPayer (the account that pays for the transaction).\nOther accounts involved in the execution of this transaction.  \n\nNext, the transaction is forwarded inside Solana, where participants of the transaction are determined according to the account data. The data added includes details about people who initiate and take part in processing the transaction. The operator of the proxy is specified as the payer. The payer will be rewarded for completing the transaction.  \nNext, the transaction is transferred to Neon EVM, where its signature is checked according to Ethereum rules. If the signature is valid, the transaction will be transferred to the Solana blockchain for execution. Since testing of N-trx is carried out, it is possible to provide Solana with all the necessary information to run the execution of the N-trx in parallel.\nConclusion\nNeon's solution offers:\n\nNo changes or additional resources are required to implement dApps on Solana.\nNo need to rewrite clients for all existing dApps, since the Ethereum node interface remains unchanged, and therefore clients can run on the Solana node also without changes.\nNo need to rewrite contracts for existing dApps.\nSolana developers are given the opportunity to:\nUse a unique toolkit created for Ethereum.\nCreate and deploy their contracts on the Solana network.\n\n\nUnlike Ethereum, the Neon EVM can be updated at any time, this means that new functionality can be added at any time and code updates can take place simply by uploading them as a new smart contract.\n\n"},"devportal/neon_evm_arch.html":{"url":"devportal/neon_evm_arch.html","title":"Overview of Neon EVM architecture","keywords":"","body":"Overview of Neon EVM Architecture\n\nThis section describes the architectural solutions built into the Neon EVM that enable fast transaction processing for Ethereum users. It also describes how tokens pass from users to final consumers.\n\nGeneral\nFor a user's transaction to be executed quickly, it must be finalized quickly. Therefore, the main task for Neon EVM developers is to ensure the prompt finalization of a transaction. Also, solutions should be developed to ensure the creation of liquid tokens by Neon EVM users and their circulation within Solana.\nSolution\nThe architectural solution based on Neon EVM is presented in Fig. 1.\n    \n Fig. 1   \n\nBelow are component descriptions of the architectural solution.\nNeon EVM user (user)Any user who has an account in Neon EVM with a balance in ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens.  \nSolana transaction (S-trx)A transaction formed according to Solana network rules with a signature produced by Solana rules.  \nNeon transaction (N-trx)A transaction formed according to Ethereum rules with a signature produced by Ethereum rules.  \nNeon EVM client (client)An application that has an EVM (Solidity/Vyper/etc.) bytecode contract loaded into Neon EVM. The application generates a transaction N-trx according to Ethereum rules and sends it to a proxy. Before sending N-trx, the client transfers the required funds to the Solana deposit to cover the costs of an operator.  \nNeon EVM operator (operator)Role performed by a Solana account using a software tool. Within Neon EVM, an operator is provided with software in the form of a proxy to fulfill certain functions. The operator can deploy either one or several proxies. They can also configure one proxy for multiple operators, as well as run several proxies with different settings.  \nNeon Web3 Proxy (proxy)The software that an operator uses to do their job. Although the proxy is not a mandatory component in the Neon EVM architecture (for example, proxy logic can be implemented inside a client's browser), implementing it as a separate component can speed up transaction processing. In the Neon EVM Mainnet, proxy must provide multithreading to work in parallel.  \nThe proxy contains an EVM emulator that pre-tests the execution of the transaction. This testing determines the number of coins required on the operator's balance, as well as the current exchange rate of SOL to ETH. Each operator configures their proxy server with this course in mind. This relates to economic motivation.  \nA proxy converts N-trx into transactions under Solana rules. N-trx is signed by a user, while S-trxs are signed by an operator. A separate account is created in Solana, to which the Neon transaction text is loaded from the received S-trxs. Neon EVM receives a command to execute the transaction located at this account address.  \nBelow is a list of the main Neon Web3 Proxy features that are implemented in the Neon EVM Testnet:\n\nReceiving requests over Web3 API protocol.\nShaping responses using Web3 API protocol.\nPackaging a Neon transaction into a Solana transaction; the Solana transaction contains the following information:\nThe Neon EVM operator account from which the amount in SOL tokens should be withdrawn for execution.\nThe Neon EVM operator account where a payment is sent for the job done in tokens specified by the user.\nThe Neon EVM account to deposit funds to be spent for iterative execution of a transaction.\nList of accounts participating in the execution of Neon transactions (formed according to Solana rules).\nThe number of steps per iteration of a Neon transaction.\n\n\nExecuting read-only Solidity methods of contracts.\nProviding a method for linking accounts from SPL-token contracts to ERC20; SPL-wrapper to access SPL-token contracts via Neon transactions.\nProviding a user with a method to switch a token to be used for gas payment.\nProviding a user with a method to execute an Neon transaction without a test run.\n\nNeon EVMThis is an Ethereum Virtual Machine compiled into Berkeley Packet Filter bytecode of a virtual machine running on Solana. Neon EVM is configured using a multisig EVM account that looks like a decentralized Neon EVM governance. Participants of the multisig EVM account (actors) can change the Neon EVM code and set up Neon EVM parameters.  \nNeon EVM governance participantThe functions performed by the governance participants:\n\nUpdating contracts.\nAdding functionality.\nEliminating shortcomings in the program code.\nChanging parameters in the settings (the fee value, opening new balance, the Mn value, the max number of iterations, etc.).  \n\nERC20 TKNThis is a contract based on the ERC20 standard token. A ERC20 token shows user balances for a certain ticker. After an account (user-acc) selects a type of token, this contract becomes blocked.  \nSPL tokenSPL token (Solana Program Library token) is a contract containing a system register of tokens that are in the system along with the Solana balances of their users. The contract implements the ERC20 interface â€” this is a description of the basic set of functions that the contract must support. Transferring funds is possible only with a contract that supports this operation.  \nSolanaThis is a blockchain containing a stream of blocks. It stores a block-log of completed operations. It also contains the current Solana state, where the results of transactions, accounts, and public keys are stored. There are also 2 balances: one for ETH tokens and and another for the token in which the transaction will be paid.  \nERC20 WrapperThis is a separate contract developed based on the ERC20 standard. It contains maps with user balances. Although this contract is hosted inside Neon EVM, it is completely standalone and independent.  \nA user can create a contract supporting the ERC20 standard for a specific token and generate the required number of tokens (coins). These tokens will only be liquid within Neon EVM. For these coins to be liquid in Solana, the SPL Token and ERC20 TKN contracts must be interoperable. This function is performed by the ERC20 Wrapper contract.\nEconomic game as a means of stimulating operators\nProcessing of a transaction is conventionally divided into several steps (iterations). Depending on the number of operations required to complete the transaction, the number of steps may vary. The next step starts only after the previous step has been successfully completed (Fig. 2).\n    \n Fig. 2   \n\nA transaction will be considered successfully completed if the \"Final\" step finishes. The execution of the transaction should not go beyond the allotted number of Mn blocks. This means that the operations performed at all steps must be completed within the Mn period, otherwise, the transaction is considered incomplete.  \nA user who forms a transaction indicates an operator (proxy) within it that will be responsible for its execution. Each operator has a deposit account in Neon EVM. These accounts belong to Neon EVM, so no one can withdraw funds from the deposit until the finalization step is completed. Before processing a transaction, Neon EVM debits the amount of funds from the operator account (op-acc) and transfers them to the operator's deposit (dep-acc).  \nIf for any reason (for example, due to a lack of funds on a deposit), an operation is not performed at a step, the next operator starts processing this transaction from the current step. This operator does not deposit any funds for the remaining steps. If they also do not complete all of the remaining steps, this process is passed to the next operator. At the \"Final\" step, a transaction is created to withdraw funds from the deposit in full, and credit them to the operator who completed this step. This implementation obliges not only the client, but also any operator involved in processing the transaction, to be interested in its successful completion.  \nExampleStep 1 - transferring funds to a deposit.Step 2 - blocking an account.Steps - other actions.Final - the deposit is returned to the operator's account (op acc). Results of the transaction have already been reflected in Solana State.  \nIn the Neon EVM settings, there is a limit on the number of blocks (Mn) during which a transaction must be completed. By default, the Mn value is 1 (that is, a transaction must be completed during the processing of one block). There is also a limit on the number of steps (the maximum number of iterations) to complete a transaction.\nThe values Mn and number of iterations are set by a Multisig account. The number of steps is also limited by funds on a user's balance.  \nAt every step, the \"Continue\" operation checks if this is the last step in the transaction execution or not.\nHow can operators find out about transactions ready to be continued?\nSolana's entire history is stored in Solana State. Using this history, the operator can obtain the necessary information about all transactions related to Neon EVM. The proxy can track incomplete transactions in this history: transactions that can be continued by another operator. The operator who wishes to continue the execution of the unfinished transaction must first re-sign it with their key. If the number of blocks does not exceed Mn since processing was begun by the previous operator, the signature of the initial operator is kept. If the number of blocks exceeds Mn, the transaction can be re-signed by any operator.\nSpecial cases\nCase 1. One of the initial and mandatory operations is blocking an account, that is, the execution of other transactions is blocked for this time.  \nFor an operator to be interested in reducing this time, they  must complete a transaction in Mn blocks, otherwise another operator will perform this transaction.  \nFor example, to go from step 1 to step 2 (see Fig.2), operator 1 must process Mn blocks. During this time, the \"Continue\" operation will not be available to other operators. If operator 1 is unable to complete a transaction during the processing of Mn blocks, this transaction remains incomplete. The funds on the balance are burned out.  \nTherefore, every operator is interested in using high-speed resources.  \nCase 2. A transaction cannot be completed if an error occurs.If step 1 is completed, and \"Cancel\" occurred in step 2, the funds are not returned to the operator. They cannot withdraw funds from a client for partial execution of a transaction. The funds are also not returned to the client. In this case, the funds on the deposit will be burned. To avoid losing funds, the operator is compelled to complete the transaction in full; not in part.  \nCase 3. Before executing a transaction, funds are checked on the user's balance, and it is also checked whether the gas limit will be exceeded. If there is a shortage of funds at some step, the transaction is fixed as \"Fail\". In this case, funds are debited from the user's account and transferred to the operator's account.  \nTransferring tokens inside Solana\nA special dApp (contract) with its token balances has been created as the ERC20 Wrapper. Application users know the address of this dApp. To transfer funds, they need to contact this dApp address specifying an account and the amount of funds to transfer. The transfer will take place within this contract.  \nThe interaction between SPL Token and ERC20 TKN is shown in Fig.3.  \n    \n Fig. 3   \n\nThere are 2 user balances:  \n\nUser SPL Balance, whose tokens are traded within Solana.\nUser ERC20 Balance, whose tokens are traded within the Neon EVM.  \n\nThe ERC20 Wrapper allows users to transfer their SPL tokens on the \"ERC20 Balance\", exchange them for tokens they need and withdraw them back. Thus, a user can create a token inside Neon EVM and transfer any number of coins from \"User SPL Balance\" to \"User ERC20 Balance\". Then, using EVM contracts, they can use these coins.\nPayment queues\nIssue descriptionIf the ERC20 TKN contract contains only one map for all users with their balances, the following conflict situation is possible: if the majority of users pay with ETH tokens, then the same contract will appear inside each N-trx, within which the value will need to be changed. This will cause all N-trxs to line up in one queue and they cannot be executed in parallel.  \nThis is because at the final step, the funds would be transferred from the user's balance to the operator's balance within one contract.  \nSolutionThe default token type field along with the balance is added to the Neon account. This field will allow a user to select a type of token for payment using the special option. To transfer SPL tokens from outside to an operator's account, use the ERC20 Wrapper.  \nThe Neon client does not have an option to select a type of token for payment and can only operate with ETH. Therefore, the storage of funds is implemented in the user's Solana State. The Neon account (user-acc) has a separate field that specifies the type of token. After a user specifies a type of token, this type will be indicated in the account field of this user. Having this information, Solana can turn to ERC20 Wrapper to convert tokens.  \nAn operator creates a deposit account for the transaction. It is possible to create a pool of such deposit accounts, so that the ERC20 Wrapper logic will select the desired transaction from this pool, and not create a queue for the payment of funds to the operator.  \nTransferring tokens between Solana and Ethereum\nThe ERC20 Wrapper allows users to manipulate balances inside SPL Token. The user runs an application inside Neon EVM with logic that releases new coins. To transfer these coins to the outside world, they need to use the ERC20 Bridge implementation. Inside Neon EVM, these coins will be blocked and transferred inside SPL Token to different addresses. They will become liquid inside Solana, but under a different token name, which is registered inside Solana.  \nA user also can transfer part of the funds to their balance inside Neon EVM and convert them into a new token using a token exchange algorithm of their choice.  \nFig. 4 shows the scheme for transferring tokens between Solana and Ethereum.  \n    \n Fig. 4   \n\nEthereum tokens are generated in accordance with the ERC20 standard. Therefore, to transfer tokens between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains, a separate ERC20 Wrapper must be deployed for each Solana token. The task of the ERC20 Wrapper is to ensure the interaction of the Solana applications with EVM (Solidity/Vyper/etc.) bytecode contracts, as well as to transfer funds in Solana tokens using Ethereum wallets such as Metamask.  \nThe main interacting component in the token transfer is the ERC20 Bridge, which is a separate contract. When itâ€™s called, it generates a Solana token which represents the corresponding ERC20 token in the SPL Token contract. The Solana tokens registered in the SPL Token contract can be transferred to Solana contracts.  \nBridge operators are responsible for the ERC20 Bridge operation. They get fees from the conversion of tokens.\n"},"devportal/value_token.html":{"url":"devportal/value_token.html","title":"Transaction value token","keywords":"","body":"Transaction Value token as an analogue of ETH for Neon EVM Solutions\n\nThis section contains introductory information about the Transaction Value token (hereinafter Value token), which is analogous to the ETH token in Neon EVM solutions.  \n\nUsing the original ETH token in Neon EVM can create additional difficulties when calculating payment of rewards to transaction participants. Therefore, the Value token is introduced to circulate inside Neon EVM. This token is analogous to ETH, coming from the Ethereum network through one of the bridges: WormHole or Sollet. Each of these bridges transfers funds (assets) from ETH-token to SPL-token and back.  \nTransfer of funds using bridges is automated, so the converted tokens are directly transferred to Neon EVM. The token conversion scheme is implemented in such a way that it allows transactions to be executed in parallel. Unlike the method of conversion through ERC20 tokens (this method is used in Ethereum, where a map is used with accounts inside a contract), this scheme does not allow transactions to line up in one queue.  \n    \n\nStoring balances inside Neon EVM\nInside Neon EVM is the Ethereum account. For each user, the Ethereum account contains two fields for storing two types of coins:\n\nETH (or USDT): a coin identifier, which is a Value token.\nPAYMENT: a token to pay for transactions; each user can create a token, which they will pay with the operator for transactions.\n\nPart of the Ethereum account code should work with ETH and the other part with PAYMENT.  \nThe Solana account is outside Neon EVM and is built as a program address of the Ethereum account. Therefore, only the Ethereum account can access the Solana account. The Solana account contains a balance in SPL tokens. All operations with a Value token are performed through an appeal to the SPL token. This balance is built in a certain fixed way according to the Ethereum account address and the Neon EVM program address. Therefore, only the Solana account can access this balance.  \nSince only a specific Ethereum account can access the Solana account, only this Ethereum account can also access the Solana account balance.  \nWhen funds are transferred between users, an SPL token is requested, and it transfers funds from one balance to another. Users' balances are stored in their accounts. This placement of balances eliminates the appearance of a queue for processing transactions.\nNeon EVM contains the ERC20 contract. This contract works with the balances of Solana's accounts (the ERC20 contract is called from inside the Solidity contract).\nCreating an Ethereum account\nAs soon as an Ethereum account is created, an SPL token balance is automatically built for a specific user. This operation can only be done by Neon EVM since only it has authorization to perform an operation from the program-account address (Solana account).  \nAfter the Ethereum account is created, it becomes possible to send a Value token to the contract to a user's balance to process transfers made from the contract code.\nPayment for execution of a transaction\nA user has the ability to choose the token in which they will pay an operator for completing a transaction.\nTo do this, the user creates an account in Neon EVM, where he can transfer ETH tokens through a bridge to pay for transactions. They automatically get a balance in the SPL token.  \n\nTransferring ETH (or USDT) tokens through one bridge (for example, through WormHole) will not be equivalent to transferring the same tokens through another bridge (for example, through Sollet). This means that the user cannot withdraw ETH tokens from their balance through one bridge (WormHole), if these tokens were transferred to this balance through another bridge (Sollet).  \n\nSince a coroutine address is linked to the user's balance, no one except this coroutine address can use this token.\nToken circulation\nWhen a user creates a transaction, they specify the cost of its execution, taking into account gas price. An operator receives the transaction for execution taking into account the cost specified by the user, as well as a fee. The user's funds are blocked to be paid to the operator following execution.  \nUser funds are transferred to the collateral pool in the form of SOL tokens. The amount of tokens needed depends on setting up a multisig account (in the current implementation, this value is hardcoded).  \nDepending on the number of operations in a transaction, it can be performed in one or several iterations.\nToken circulation for transaction execution in one iteration\nBefore executing a transaction, an operator transfers funds to the Neon token collateral pool. At the same time, they pay a fee to the validator for checking signatures and pays rent for storing data on the balance of the account.  \nAfter the transaction is completed, PAYMENT tokens are transferred from the user's balance to the operator's balance to cover the costs.\nToken circulation for transaction execution in multiple iterations\nUnlike a non-iterative transaction, the payment of funds to operators is added to make them more interested in facilitating faster transaction execution. This is done so that the accounts involved in the process are not blocked for an extended period of time.  \nAt the start of an iterative transaction, an operator transfers a fee to the collateral pool, as well as funds (SOL tokens) to a special deposit account. The funds in this account will be paid to the operator who completes the transaction.  The fee will be paid for execution costs over multiple iterations.  \nThe priority to receive funds from a deposit is given to the operator who sent the transaction for execution.  \nA transaction contains the name of the operator that is executing it. Also, the transaction indicates the block number when the last activity of this operator was. If fewer blocks have passed than the hardcoded value of the blocks, then this operator can continue the transaction. Only the operator specified in it can cancel the transaction. If more blocks have passed, then any operator can continue the transaction. The right to execute the transaction passes to the operator that intercepts this execution, that is, who is ahead of the others.  \nThe right to withdraw funds from a deposit is granted to the operator who performs the final step. At this step, the user's funds are transferred to the deposit.  \nIf for some reason a transaction is canceled (using the \"Cancel\" operation), the blocked funds of a user are returned to them. The deposit that was frozen is burned. No payout is made to operators. This is done so that operators are motivated to complete the transaction.  \n"},"devportal/metamask_setup.html":{"url":"devportal/metamask_setup.html","title":"Installing and setting up MetaMask","keywords":"","body":"Installing and setting up MetaMask\nMetaMask wallet is a convenient and fairly easy-to-use application for storing Ethereum addresses and private keys.\nGoal\nTo install the MetaMask on your device to connect the wallet to the Solana Testnet environment.  \nDevice requirements\nA browser which supports the MetaMask must be installed on your device.

A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia trie that encodes the storage contents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values. This trie encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.\n\nExternally-owned accounts\nAn account is made up of a cryptographic pair of keys: public and private. They help prove that a transaction was  signed by the sender and prevent forgeries. Your private key is what you use to sign transactions, so it grants you custody over the funds associated with your account. You never really hold cryptocurrency, you hold private keys â€“ the funds are always on Ethereum's ledger.\nAccount creation\nWhen you have to create an account most libraries will generate a random private key for you.A private key is made up of 64 hex characters and can be encrypted with a password.  \nExample:ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff48a03bbfd25e8cd036415febaaedce6a  \nThe public key is generated from the private key using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. To get a public address for your account, you need to add 0x before the last 20 bytes of the public key.\nContract accounts\nContract accounts have a 42 character hexadecimal address:  \nExample:0x02042f8cf97ae237070f9587f8e7a266dbead5de  \nThe contract address is given when a contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. The address comes from the creator's address and the number of transactions sent from that address (nonce)  \n\nNoteAn account is not a wallet. A wallet is the keypair associated with a user-owned account, which allows a user to make transactions from or manage the account.\nMore detailsETHEREUM ACCOUNTS\n\n"},"software_manuals/foundational_topics/transaction.html":{"url":"software_manuals/foundational_topics/transaction.html","title":"Transaction","keywords":"","body":"An Ethereum transaction\nAn Ethereum transaction is a cryptographically signed instruction from an account. The account initiates a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. An Ethereum transaction refers to an action initiated by an external account, i.e. an account managed by a person, not a contract.  \nA transaction, which changes the state of the EVM, needs to be broadcast to the whole network. Any node can broadcast a request for a transaction to be executed on the EVM. Transactions require a fee and must be mined to become valid.\nWhat is in a transaction?\nA transaction includes the following information:\n\nRecipient â€“ recipient address.\nSignature â€“ identifier of the sender (sender's signature with a private key).\nValue â€“ amount of coins to transfer from sender to recipient.\nData â€“ (optional field) arbitrary data.\nGasLimit â€“ maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction.\nGasPrice â€“ fee the sender pays per unit of gas.\n\nNote\n\nThe block that your transaction is placed in can also contain many other transactions. Checking such a block for the validity of transactions may take more time. Higher priority transactions are served first.\nIf the network is busy and miners aren't able to keep up, they always prioritise transactions with higher GasPrice because they get to keep the fees.\nA transaction gets a block confirmation number. This is the number of blocks created since the block that this transaction was included in. The higher the number, the greater the certainty that the transaction was processed and recognised by the network. For higher value transactions, more block confirmations may be desired.\n\n\nMore detailsTransactions\n\n"},"software_manuals/foundational_topics/block.html":{"url":"software_manuals/foundational_topics/block.html","title":"Block","keywords":"","body":"Block\nBlocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain. Hashes link blocks together (in a chain) because they are cryptographically derived from the block data. One change in any block in history will invalidate all the following blocks. This feature protects the blocks in a chain from tampering.  \nTo preserve the transaction history, blocks are strictly ordered (every new block created contains a reference to its parent block), and transactions within blocks are strictly ordered too.\nWhat is in a block?\n\nTimestamp â€“ the time when the block was mined.\nBlock number â€“ the length of the blockchain in blocks.\nDifficulty â€“ the effort required to mine the block.\nMixHash â€“ a unique identifier for that block.\nParent hash â€“ the unique identifier for the block that came before (this is how blocks are linked in a chain).\nTransactions list â€“ the transactions included in the block.\nState root â€“ the entire state of the system: account balances, contract storage, contract code and account nonces.\nNonce â€“ a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that the block has gone through proof of work.\n\nBlock size\nBlocks themselves are bounded in size. Each block has a block gas limit which is set by the network and the miners collectively: the total amount of gas expended by all transactions in the block must be less than the block gas limit.\n\nMore detailsBlocks\n\n"},"software_manuals/foundational_topics/gas.html":{"url":"software_manuals/foundational_topics/gas.html","title":"Gas","keywords":"","body":"Gas\nGas is required for the Ethereum network. This is the fuel that allows it to work, just as a car needs gasoline to run.  \nWhat is gas?\nGas is a unit of measurement that determines the amount of computational effort required to perform certain operations on the Ethereum network.  \nSince each transaction requires computational resources to execute, each transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on the network.  \nPerforming any operation on Ethereum requires gas consumption. This includes calculations, storing or manipulating data, or transferring tokens, each consuming different amounts of \"gas\" units. As dApp functionality becomes more complex, the number of operations a smart contract performs grows too, and all of them lead to large amounts of gas that must be paid for.\nWhat is gas limit?\nGas limit means the maximum amount of gas you are willing to consume on a transaction. A higher gas limit means more computational work can be done while interacting with smart contracts.  \nFor example if you put a gas limit of 50,000 for a simple coin transfer, the coins would consume 21,000, and you would get back the remaining 29,000. However, if you specify too little gas say for example, a gas limit of 20,000 for a simple coin transfer, the coins will consume your 20,000 gas units attempting to fulfill the txn, but it will not complete. The EVM then reverts any changes, but since 20k gas units worth of work has already been done that gas is consumed.\n\nMore detailsGAS and FEES\n\n"},"software_manuals/foundational_topics/proof-of-work.html":{"url":"software_manuals/foundational_topics/proof-of-work.html","title":"Proof-of-Work","keywords":"","body":"Proof-of-Work\nProof-of-work (PoW) is a consensus protocol (proof-of-work completion) that allows the decentralized Ethereum network to come to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions. This prevents users \"double spending\" their coins and ensures that the Ethereum chain is incredibly difficult to attack or overwrite.\nHow does Ethereum's PoW work?\nEthereum transactions are processed into blocks.

It also maintains anonymity and security, since the cryptocurrency is already distributed among the users of the network.  \nUnlike PoW, validators don't need to use significant amounts of computational power because they're selected at random and aren't competing. They don't need to mine blocks; they just need to create blocks when chosen and validate proposed blocks when they're not. This validation is known as attesting.\nThe PoS concept\n\nThe PoS concept states that a person can mine or verify block transactions depending on how many coins he holds; this means that the more coins a miner owns, the more mining power he has.\nThe probability of checking a new block is determined by how large the share that a person holds.\nValidators do not receive block rewards; instead, they take network commission as their reward.\nUnlike PoW, PoS systems can be more cost-effective and efficient, but less decentralized.\n\n\nMore detailsPROOF of STAKE\n\n"},"software_manuals/how_to_guides.html":{"url":"software_manuals/how_to_guides.html","title":"How to guides","keywords":"","body":"How to guides\n\nHow to deploy an Ethereum contract\n\n"},"software_manuals/how_to_guides/deploy_contract.html":{"url":"software_manuals/how_to_guides/deploy_contract.html","title":"How to deploy an Ethereum contract","keywords":"","body":"How to deploy an Ethereum contract\nGoal\nTo deploy a smart contract for it to be available to users of an Ethereum network.To deploy a smart contract, you have to:\n\nCompile your smart contract.\nCreate and send an Ethereum transaction containing the code of the compiled smart contract without specifying any recipients.\n\nBefore you begin\n\nUnderstand the following:\nWhat is the Ethereum network.\nWhat is a transaction.\nWhat is a smart contract.\nWhat are gas and fees.\nHow to compile a smart contract.\n\n\nMake sure you have some ETH to pay a transaction fee.\n\nSteps\nStep 1.

Also, the user can perform the reverse operation â€” withdraw tokens from the staked state to active.  \n\nTransaction\nA complete all-or-nothing change to the blockchain. A combination of one or more actions. Usually the execution result of a smart contract.  \n\nWallet\nWallets are clients that store keys that may or may not be associated with the permissions of one or more accounts.
